<h3 id="what-is-moss">What is Moss?</h3>
<p>Moss is a dynamically typed programming language, that allows
functional and object oriented programming.

<p>The program <code>moss</code>, written in lower case, consists
of a small compiler and a larger byte code interpreter. It is also
available as a library that could be integrated into another
program.

<h3 id="what-is-this-suitable-for">What is Moss suitable for?</h3>
<p>Moss is meant to be a general purpose programming language, but
it is certainly not suitable for everything. Most well suited would
it be for scripting or as an interface language to performant programs.

<p>For example, Moss is developed together with a scientific library,
a matrix caculator and a plotting library, serving purposes similar to
SciPy, Matlab/Octave, Gnuplot and Matplotlib.

<p>Moss is not suitable for programs that should run
performant on the bare metal cold or for large complex systems,
due to its lack of a static type system and optimizations.

<p>Be aware that callback functions written in a dynamically typed
language might slow down systems written in a performant
language. If callback functions occur at critical locations, it might
be necessary to reformulate the whole procedure in the performant
language.

<h3 id="what-is-the-goal">What is the project goal?</h3>

<p>The project goals are so far:
<ul>
<li>Showing that a type safe and memory safe
  implementation is possible.
<li>Determining a design of a Rust-Moss ecosystem.
<li>Doing research in the design of interpreter kernels.
<li>A first language for teaching computer programming.
<li>An enhanced calculator, providing long integers, exact rational
numbers, multiple-precision floating point numbers, matrix
calculations and a large number of numerical routines and special
functions.
</ul>
