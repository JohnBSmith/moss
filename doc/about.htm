<h2>About Moss</h2>

<p><b>Aim of the project:</b> Development of a dynamic high level
programming language, well suited for everyday use.

<p><b>Author:</b> John Smith (<code><a href="http://johnbsmith.github.io/"
  >http://johnbsmith.github.io/</a></code>).

<p><b>License:</b> All files of the Moss project
are released under the terms of the Creative Commons CC0 license.
Furthermore, I commit myself to place any future release

<p>This software is provided without any warranty.
It is not recommended to use this implementation in safety
critical applications of any kind.

can be built upon.
