>A complication with traits</h3>

<p>So I set up a type system with general type inference and
parametric polymorphism. One can already state such code:
<pre class="moss indent">
function map[X,Y](a: List[X], f: X-&gt;Y): List[Y]
   let b = []
   for x in a
      b.push(f(x))
   end
   return b
end

let a = map(list(1..10), |x| 2*x)
print(a)
</pre>
<p>Or this:
<pre class="moss indent">
let compose = |g,f| |x| g(f(x))
let add = |x,y| x+y
let h = compose(|x| add(x,1), |x| add(x,1))
print(h(0))
</pre>
<p>The type inference algorithm deduces:
<pre class="indent">
compose: (Int-&gt;Int,Int-&gt;Int)-&gt;Int-&gt;Int
add: (Int,Int)-&gt;Int
h: Int-&gt;Int
</pre>

<p>One can also state <code>compose</code> in polymorphic fashion:
<pre class="moss indent">
function compose[X,Y,Z](g: Y-&gt;Z, f: X-&gt;Y): X-&gt;Z
   return |x| g(f(x))
end
</pre>

<p>Currently, there is no notion of mutability, because firstly this
introduces a subtype relation and secondly I don't know whether it
should become a first class feature of the type system or not. The
type system and type checker will become more complex, one has to
work out what the best algorithms would be.

<p>Of course, reassignable variables are introduced with another
syntax &ndash; <code>var</code> &ndash; instead of <code>let</code>.
That's not the same as mutability, although both concepts are slightly
intertwined in Rust.

<p>Regarding parametric polymorphism with type variables restricted
by traits, a further complication emerges. Let's have a look
at this code:
<pre class="moss indent">
function pow[T: Mul+One](x: T, n: Int): T
   var y = T.one
   for k in 1..n
      y = y*x
   end
   return y
end

print(pow(2,10))
</pre>

<p>Here, <code>pow</code> needs the type <code>T</code> at runtime,
because it occurs explicitly in <code>T.one</code>. One could obtain
it through <code>x</code>, but in general this is not feasible
&mdash; for example, one cannot simply obtain the element type of
list, because the list could be empty, and an empty list does
not know its element type at runtime.

<p>The best approach would be to give the type as an additional
argument. The resulting code at runtime would be:

<pre class="moss indent">
# impl One for Int
Int.one = 1

function pow(x,n,T)
   y = T.one
   for k in 1..n
      y = y*x
   end
   return y
end

print(pow(2,10,Int))
</pre>

<p>This means, the ABI of a polymorphic function type would depend
one the standalone occurrence of the type. Thus one must take care,
this information is not erased during unification. It would be
easier if the type argument is given explicitly for every type
variable restricted by a trait.
