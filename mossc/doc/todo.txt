# How to type the power operation for integers?
In general, the return value would have sum type Int+Float. Another
option would be (Int,Nat)->Int. Another option would be (Int,Int)->Int
with runtime check.
  
For the polynomial case, (Int,Nat)->Int would be fine.

# How to type mutability?
It could be solved with a type constructor and a subtype relation.
